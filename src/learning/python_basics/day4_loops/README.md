# Day 4 â€“ Loops

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Use `for` and `while` loops to repeat code efficiently.
- Control loops with `range()`, counters, and sentinel values.
- Apply `break` and `continue` statements appropriately.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Loops save time by running blocks of code repeatedly. Day 4 guides you through counting with `for`, using `while` to wait for a condition, and combining loops with conditionals. By practicing different loop patterns, you will see how iteration powers many Python programs.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `multiplication_table.py` â€“ prints multiplication tables using nested `for` loops.
2. `sum_even_numbers.py` â€“ calculates the sum of even numbers within a user-defined range.
3. `countdown_timer.py` â€“ counts down using a `while` loop and demonstrates `time.sleep()`.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `multiplication_table_bug.py`: Fix loop boundaries and formatting errors.
- `sum_even_numbers_bug.py`: Correct range logic to only add even values.
- `countdown_timer_bug.py`: Repair while loop termination mistakes.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Create a script that prints every third number between two inputs.
- Ask the user for a word and print each character on a new line.
- Build a simple guessing game that gives the player three attempts.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- When is a `while` loop easier to use than a `for` loop?
- How does `break` affect loop execution?
- Why is it important to update loop variables inside a `while` loop?
