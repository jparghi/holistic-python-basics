# Day 5 â€“ Lists and Tuples

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Create and modify lists using indexing and slicing.
- Understand tuple immutability and when to use tuples instead of lists.
- Iterate over sequences to process items and collect results.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Lists and tuples store ordered data. Lists are mutable and great for dynamic collections, while tuples hold fixed groupings. Day 5 explores adding, removing, and slicing items, as well as iterating for summaries. You will also learn to unpack tuples for clarity.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `grocery_list_manager.py` â€“ adds and removes grocery items from a list.
2. `tuple_unpacking_demo.py` â€“ demonstrates unpacking tuple data into readable variables.
3. `playlist_editor.py` â€“ manages a list of songs and shows how to reorder items.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `grocery_list_manager_bug.py`: Repair indexing mistakes and list modifications.
- `tuple_unpacking_demo_bug.py`: Fix tuple length mismatches and unpacking errors.
- `playlist_editor_bug.py`: Correct slicing issues when reordering songs.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Ask the user for five favorite movies and print them in reverse order.
- Combine two lists of ingredients and remove duplicates.
- Store coordinates as tuples and calculate the midpoint.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- When should you choose a tuple instead of a list?
- How does slicing help with list manipulation?
- What strategies keep list operations organized and readable?
