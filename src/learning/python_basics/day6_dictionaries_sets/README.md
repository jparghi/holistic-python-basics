# Day 6 â€“ Dictionaries and Sets

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Create dictionaries to map keys to values and update them dynamically.
- Use sets to manage unique items and perform set algebra operations.
- Iterate through key-value pairs and set elements effectively.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Dictionaries and sets provide powerful ways to organize data. Dictionaries pair keys and values for fast lookups, while sets store unique items. Day 6 covers creating, updating, deleting, and iterating through these structures. You will also explore union, intersection, and difference to solve real problems.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `contact_book.py` â€“ stores contact information in a dictionary and allows updates.
2. `set_operations.py` â€“ demonstrates union, intersection, and difference on hobby sets.
3. `word_frequency_counter.py` â€“ counts word occurrences from user input.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `contact_book_bug.py`: Fix key access issues and update logic.
- `set_operations_bug.py`: Correct set method usage mistakes.
- `word_frequency_counter_bug.py`: Repair counting errors and missing normalization.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Create a dictionary that tracks homework completion status.
- Build a vocabulary quiz using a dictionary of words and definitions.
- Store a set of visited countries and compare with a friend's set.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- How do dictionaries make data retrieval easier compared to lists?
- When is it useful to convert a list to a set?
- What strategies prevent `KeyError` exceptions when accessing dictionary data?
