# Day 8 â€“ Strings

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Manipulate strings with slicing and common string methods.
- Understand string immutability and how to create new strings from existing ones.
- Format strings using f-strings and the `format()` method.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Strings store text, and Python provides many tools for shaping them. Day 8 explores slicing, methods like `.upper()` and `.replace()`, and formatting techniques. By the end, you will be able to clean, search, and transform strings for different purposes.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `string_methods_showcase.py` â€“ demonstrates a variety of string methods and their outcomes.
2. `palindrome_checker.py` â€“ checks whether user input reads the same forward and backward.
3. `substring_finder.py` â€“ searches for a keyword within a larger string and reports the position.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `string_methods_showcase_bug.py`: Fix incorrect method usage and missing variables.
- `palindrome_checker_bug.py`: Repair logic errors in palindrome detection.
- `substring_finder_bug.py`: Correct case-sensitivity issues and invalid indexes.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Ask for a sentence and count the vowels it contains.
- Build a script that masks email addresses except for the first letter.
- Create a function that reverses the words in a sentence.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- Why are strings immutable, and how does that affect slicing?
- When should you prefer f-strings over concatenation?
- How can string methods simplify data cleaning tasks?
