# Day 1 â€“ Variables, Input, and Output

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand how to store data in variables using clear names.
- Practice reading user input with `input()` and displaying results with `print()`.
- Use f-strings to format output messages in a friendly way.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Day 1 introduces the building blocks of every Python program: variables and console interaction. You will learn how to capture data from users, convert types when needed, and format the output for clarity. F-strings make it easy to combine text with variables, and this day focuses on writing small, conversational scripts.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `greet_user.py` â€“ prompts for a name and favorite hobby, then prints a personalized greeting.
2. `simple_calculator.py` â€“ collects two numbers from the user and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient.
3. `story_generator.py` â€“ gathers imaginative words from the user and assembles a short story using f-strings.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `greet_user_bug.py`: Fix syntax mistakes so the greeting prints correctly.
- `simple_calculator_bug.py`: Resolve type conversion issues preventing arithmetic from running.
- `story_generator_bug.py`: Correct string formatting errors so the story reads naturally.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Ask the user for two cities and print a travel message that uses both names and their lengths.
- Build a currency converter that multiplies user input by an exchange rate.
- Prompt for three favorite foods and print them in a single formatted sentence.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- How do variables help you reuse values in a program?
- When should you convert user input into numbers?
- Why might f-strings be easier to read than string concatenation?
