# Day 10 â€“ Mini Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Combine concepts from the previous days into cohesive programs.
- Plan, structure, and document a small multi-feature project.
- Test and debug code that integrates input, processing, and output.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Day 10 challenges you to apply everything you have learned. The mini projects encourage planning, modular design, and user interaction. Each example weaves together variables, conditionals, loops, collections, and functions to create useful tools.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `quiz_master.py` â€“ runs a short quiz using dictionaries, loops, and scoring.
2. `task_tracker.py` â€“ allows users to add, complete, and review tasks stored in a list.
3. `expense_splitter.py` â€“ calculates how to split expenses evenly among friends.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `quiz_master_bug.py`: Fix scoring logic and input validation issues.
- `task_tracker_bug.py`: Repair list updates and loop flow.
- `expense_splitter_bug.py`: Correct division and rounding mistakes.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Create a contact manager that saves data to a file and loads it on start.
- Build a simple flashcard system with hints and scoring.
- Design a budgeting tool that categorizes spending.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- How does planning help when creating a larger program?
- Which Python concepts felt most natural to use together?
- What features would you add if you had more time?
