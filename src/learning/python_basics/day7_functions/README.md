# Day 7 â€“ Functions

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Define functions with parameters and return values.
- Understand variable scope within and outside functions.
- Use functions to organize code into reusable blocks.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Functions keep code tidy by wrapping logic into named blocks. Day 7 covers creating functions, passing arguments, returning results, and documenting behavior. The examples showcase reusable utilities, default parameters, and the benefits of splitting work into smaller pieces.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `math_utilities.py` â€“ provides functions to calculate squares, cubes, and averages.
2. `greeting_functions.py` â€“ demonstrates functions with parameters and default values.
3. `shopping_total.py` â€“ uses helper functions to compute totals and apply discounts.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `math_utilities_bug.py`: Fix return statements and incorrect calculations.
- `greeting_functions_bug.py`: Correct parameter usage and string formatting.
- `shopping_total_bug.py`: Repair scope issues and discount logic.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Write a function that returns the larger of two numbers.
- Create a reusable function that validates email addresses.
- Build a program that uses functions to convert temperatures.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- When should you return a value versus printing from a function?
- How does scope affect variables defined inside functions?
- What makes a function easy to reuse in different programs?
