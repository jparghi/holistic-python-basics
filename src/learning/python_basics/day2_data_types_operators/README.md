# Day 2 â€“ Data Types and Operators

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Distinguish between numeric, string, and boolean data types in Python.
- Perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations confidently.
- Convert between types to ensure operations behave as expected.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Day 2 dives into the built-in data types and the operators that manipulate them. Understanding how integers, floats, strings, and booleans differ sets the stage for more complex programs. You will experiment with arithmetic formulas, comparison checks, and logical expressions.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `number_operations.py` â€“ demonstrates arithmetic operations and type conversion on user input.
2. `comparison_checker.py` â€“ compares two numbers and reports which is larger or if they are equal.
3. `logic_truth_table.py` â€“ shows how boolean logic operators `and`, `or`, and `not` evaluate.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `number_operations_bug.py`: Spot and fix integer division and type casting mistakes.
- `comparison_checker_bug.py`: Repair comparison logic and variable usage errors.
- `logic_truth_table_bug.py`: Correct boolean expressions that always return the wrong result.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Build a BMI calculator that uses weight and height input from the user.
- Write a script that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- Ask for a password and check if it meets length and character requirements.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- Why is it important to know the type of data you are working with?
- How do comparison operators support decision making in programs?
- When can the `not` operator simplify a conditional expression?
