# Day 3 â€“ Conditionals

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow.
- Combine relational and logical operators to evaluate complex conditions.
- Provide user feedback based on different decision branches.

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview
Conditionals let programs make choices. By stacking and nesting `if` statements, you can respond to user input in flexible ways. Day 3 focuses on reading a scenario, checking conditions, and printing helpful results. The examples highlight both straightforward and nested logic.

## ðŸ’» Example Programs (Python)
1. `grade_classifier.py` â€“ converts a numeric score into a letter grade with helpful feedback.
2. `ticket_price_calculator.py` â€“ determines ticket prices based on age and membership status.
3. `weather_advisor.py` â€“ offers clothing and activity suggestions depending on temperature and conditions.

## ðŸª² Bug-Fix Exercises
- `grade_classifier_bug.py`: Fix logical errors that mislabel grades.
- `ticket_price_calculator_bug.py`: Correct membership checks and price calculations.
- `weather_advisor_bug.py`: Repair missing conditionals that cause incorrect suggestions.

## ðŸ§  Practice Challenges
- Ask for a year and determine if it is a leap year.
- Request a password and validate strength using multiple criteria.
- Prompt for a color choice and describe what it represents.

## ðŸ§˜ Reflection Questions
- What order should you check conditions in when multiple cases are possible?
- How do logical operators simplify complex decisions?
- When does nesting conditionals make the code harder to read?
