# 🐍 Holistic Python Basics – Codex Generation Guide (Phase 1)

## 🏷️ Metadata
```yaml
repo_target: holistic-python-basics
mode: Codex Automation (Code + Docs Generation)
root_folder: src/learning/python_basics
language: Python 3
output_bundle: /dist/python_basics.zip
````

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **complete Python Basics module** covering the first 10 foundational concepts in Python programming — from syntax and data types to loops and functions.
Codex should generate instructional READMEs, clean working `.py` files, and buggy versions for debugging practice, following **PEP 8** and **educational clarity**.

This repo serves as the **Phase 1 foundation** before moving to advanced or Java-parallel phases.

## 🧩 Daily Deliverables

### 1️⃣ README.md

Include these sections:

* 🎯 Learning Goals
* 📘 Concept Overview
* 💻 Example Programs (Python)
* 🪲 Bug-Fix Exercises
* 🧠 Practice Challenges
* 🧘 Reflection Questions

### 2️⃣ Python Source Files

* **Working programs:** `program_name.py` (3–5 per day)
* **Buggy versions:** `program_name_bug.py` (syntax / logic errors)
* Follow consistent headers:

```python

## 🧠 Teaching Guidelines

* Follow **PEP 8** style and naming.
* Use comments generously for explanation.
* No third-party packages — only Python built-ins.
* Encourage interaction with `input()` / `print()`.
* Keep tone **educational and beginner-friendly**.

---

## ⚙️ Codex Automation Goals

* 🏗️ Auto-generate all 10 day folders + files.
* 🧾 Produce structured README.md and sample programs.
* 🪲 Include buggy code variants for debugging practice.
* 📦 Package as `/dist/python_basics.zip` ready for Git commit.
* 🧭 Print a final log summary listing folders/files created.

---

## ✅ Expected Output

* 10 daily learning folders.
* Each with: `README.md`, 3–5 clean `.py` files, 3–5 `_bug.py` files.
* ZIP archive: `/dist/python_basics.zip`.
* Terminal log confirming generation success.
