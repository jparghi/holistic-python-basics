# Holistic Python Basics

Holistic Python Basics is a collection of bite-sized lessons and exercises that cover the
fundamentals of Python programming. Each "day" introduces a focused topic through
concept explanations, runnable examples, and short practice problems.

## Repository Structure

The learning materials live under [`src/learning/python_basics`](src/learning/python_basics):

- **Day 1 – Variables, Input, and Output**: Working with variables, formatted strings,
  and user interaction.
- **Day 2 – Data Types and Operators**: Exploring numeric types, boolean logic, and
  arithmetic/comparison operators.
- **Day 3 – Conditionals**: Writing branching logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **Day 4 – Loops**: Iterating with `for` and `while` loops while practicing control flow.
- **Day 5 – Lists and Tuples**: Managing sequence data and common list operations.
- **Day 6 – Dictionaries and Sets**: Mapping keys to values and working with unique
  collections.
- **Day 7 – Functions**: Defining reusable behavior, parameters, and return values.
- **Day 8 – Strings**: Manipulating text, slicing, and string methods.
- **Day 9 – File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using Python's standard library.
- **Day 10 – Mini Project**: Applying the preceding lessons in a small, cohesive project.

Each day folder typically contains a `README.md` with a lesson overview and a `src/`
subdirectory with runnable scripts or exercises.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd holistic-python-basics
   ```
2. Explore a lesson by navigating into its directory. For example, to run the
   Day 1 examples:
   ```bash
   cd src/learning/python_basics/day1_variables_input_output/src
   python <script-name>.py
   ```
3. Modify the scripts or create new ones as you experiment with the concepts.
